JDox Visualization Tool
Developed by Brendan Hagan

This tool was developed entirely in Mathematica, which comes as a standard install on all STScI machines. To use this tool, simply save the Execute_JDox_GUI.nb and MathematicaJDoxGUIinitFin.wl files to the same directory and then open the Execute_JDox_GUI.nb file - the code will automatically start running. The GUI will appear once the code is *finished* gathering data from all the pages at https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/ - this initialization should take between ~5-20 minutes depending upon your computer, then the GUI will appear.
